GateKeeper
==========

Description
-----------

The aim of this project is to provide temporary access to 
administrators to certain services in a box that would otherwise
be blocked by iptables. This way, administrators can connect from
different IPs without having to allow all of them in the box's
firewall. This is most useful when there are dynamic IPs involved.

How it works
------------

The client connects through a browser to a CGI page served by a
webserver (in this case apache2). The CGI presents a form with a
list of available services. When the client submits the form,
the CGI executes two scripts: one to allow the IP to connect and
another to remove this ACCEPT rule after two minutes.

Testing
-------

In order to test the application spin up the vagrant box and
start a netcat server listening on port 900:

    nc -p 9000 -l -v -k

Then, in the host, execute:

    echo 'hello' | nc localhost 9080

This should not show anything in the guest.

Open a browser and go to 

    http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/gatekeeper.cgi

And fill in the form to open port 9000 and submit. Then, repeat
the `echo` command and it should appear in the guest. After two
minutes, try again and it should fail.
